# A Posture Classifier (Detects between good and bad postures)
This is a simple project built to show how web developers can quickly train and embed machine learning models in their web applications. It was presented as part of a talk at DevFest Ajah 2021. 

Feel free to extend this project to include more features.
## Model
The model was trained using Teachabele Machine and was exported as a TensorFlow.js model.
The model can be found in the public folder.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
